Dear Hiring Manager,

## Opening Paragraph

[EXPRESS INTEREST IN SPECIFIC ROLE AND COMPANY]

*Guidelines:*
- Express interest in the specific role and company
- Include a personal explanation for why I am applying
- This could be an interest in the technology or the background industry (i.e., related to physics)
- Do not just repeat phrases used in the job description

## Core Skills Paragraph

I am a highly motivated full-stack software engineer with a strong foundation in physics, which sharpens my analytical and problem-solving skills. My experience as a full-stack engineer at a fast-paced AI startup has equipped me with a strong foundation in designing, building, and deploying robust software solutions in an Agile environment. My technical skills - including Python (FastAPI, PyTorch), TypeScript/JavaScript (React, Next.js), and comprehensive experience with AWS services (Lambda, ECS, SQS, CloudFormation, etc.) for cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines - [directly match the requirements for this role / position me well for this role].

## Experience Paragraph

[HIGHLIGHT SPECIFIC RELEVANT EXPERIENCE]

*Options to consider:*

**Full-stack focus:** My professional experience has been focused on full-stack development, and I have a proven capability to take complex services from concept to production.

**Backend focus:** My professional experience has been focused on backend development, and I have a proven capability to take complex services from concept to production.

**Architecture experience:** I was selected to join a scout team to design a long-term event-driven microservice architecture.

**Cross-functional collaboration:** I have extensive experience working cross-functionally, from collaborating with data scientists to mentoring new hires and delivering technical presentations.

## Company-Specific Paragraph (Optional)

[ADD IF THERE'S SPECIFIC ALIGNMENT]

*Examples:*
- **For ML/AI companies:** Mention Bayesian optimization, BoTorch experience, uncertainty quantification
- **For product-focused roles:** Emphasize product ownership mindset, user-centric approach
- **For specific tech stack:** Highlight alignment or willingness to learn

## Personal Projects Paragraph

This passion for development extends beyond my professional roles. I am currently undertaking a bikepacking trip from England towards Bangladesh and have been building and deploying several full-stack projects along the way. For example, my findkairos.com project is a web app built with a Python FastAPI backend, MongoDB, and deployed serverlessly on AWS Lambda, with a Next.js frontend. [Optional: Add specific connection to role if relevant]

## Closing Paragraph

Given my current journey, I am most readily reachable via email (jasper66018@gmail.com) or WhatsApp (+447423781157) [to arrange a video call at your convenience / for any questions].

I am confident that my technical skills, proactive problem-solving approach, and self-motivated mindset would make me a valuable addition to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration. [Optional: Add "I have attached my CV for your review and look forward to the possibility of discussing this opportunity further." if submitting CV]
