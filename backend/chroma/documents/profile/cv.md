## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Software Engineer
**digiLab - AI Technology Startup**  
*September 2023 - June 2025*

- Core product team engineer building a machine learning workflow platform from the ground up, working in a fast-paced startup environment to deliver production-ready systems.
- Selected for a scout team with the CEO, CTO, and lead architect to design our long-term event-driven microservice architecture - enabling modular development that helped data scientists contribute 100% faster.
- Rapidly brought a complex microservice from concept to production in 2 months despite shifting requirements, implementing token-based authentication (AWS Cognito), user analytics (CloudWatch), and scalable event-driven patterns.
- Designed, deployed, and maintained AWS-based infrastructure using Docker containers, CloudFormation templates, and automated CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), reducing developer time spent on deployment by 99%.
- Extended our internal machine learning library with Gaussian Process models using PyTorch and BoTorch, improving uncertainty quantification accuracy for production ML workflows.
- Helped onboard graduate hires and consistently received positive feedback for being approachable and supportive; delivered knowledge-sharing presentations to help the team level up.
- Provided direct product support to internal and external clients, ensuring successful demos and smooth adoption.
- Served as the employee association representative, leading discussions on workplace improvements with the founders. Secured office amenities, approved time for internal AI seminars, and helped form an internal AI ethics committee.

## PROJECTS & CURRENT WORK

During my ongoing bikepacking journey from England to Bangladesh, I've been building and deploying software projects inspired by the trip. These demonstrate my love for software development and ability to apply my skills to solve real-world problems.

### findkairos.com
**Full-stack web application for connecting bikepackers worldwide**

- Built scalable backend using Python FastAPI with MongoDB (leveraging GeoSpatial indexing for location-based queries), deployed as serverless functions on AWS Lambda.
- Developed responsive frontend with Next.js and Mapbox integration, statically hosted on AWS (S3 + CloudFront) for optimal performance.
- Implemented automated OpenAPI TypeScript client generation that publishes to npm when a new backend version deploys, ensuring type-safe API consumption.
- Designed secure token-based authentication system and scalable database schema supporting complex user journey tracking.

### jaspercycles.com
**Personal project tracking my bikepacking journey in real time**

- Developed React + Vite frontend that integrates with the Strava API to record my progress as I cycle.
- Deployed as static site on AWS infrastructure (S3 + CloudFront) with automated deployment pipeline.

## ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Research Intern - GPU Programming for Quantum Spin Dynamics
**University of Exeter**  
*Summer 2022*

- Developed optimised Python package for GPU-accelerated matrix exponent calculations using CUDA, achieving a 60% performance improvement in quantum dynamics simulations running on HPC infrastructure.
- Gained understanding of low-level GPU programming through CUDA kernel development and CuBLAS library integration - refreshed my C knowledge in the process.
- Learned GPU optimization techniques for numerical computing applications.

## EDUCATION

### Master of Science in Physics
**University of Exeter**  
*2019 - 2023*  
**Grade:** Upper Second-Class Honours (2:1) - Average: 69%

**Master's Thesis:** The Application of Machine Learning to the Inverse Scattering Problem
